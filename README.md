# YOLOv5 Object Detection

This repository contains the implementation of **YOLOv5** (You Only Look Once version 5) for **real-time object detection**. YOLOv5 is a popular, fast, and accurate deep learning model that can detect objects in images and videos. In this project, we will train YOLOv5 on a custom dataset for object detection and run it for inference on new data.
